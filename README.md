There is a public-domain .csv file of the database that MyFitnessPal uses on Kaggle. This contain contains 587,187 days of food diary records logged by 9,990 MyFitnessPal users from September 2014 through April 2015. Each section is a column separated list of different variables.

The user can implement these changes in this application. Here, I committed an NLP model that allows the user to select meals based upon their preferred nutrients.

Having a healthly lifestyle is important to live a long and fruitful life. More and more people try to enhance their health by doing regularly different sports and put emphasis on their food habits. In order to satisfy the specific needs of every individual, conclusions gained out of the usersâ€™ data are of high importance. The healthcare industry is booming, especially when it comes to the analysis of health-related data. 39% of adults worldwide and over 65% of US adults are clinically overweight or diagnosed with obesity. Overweight and obesity increase the risk for health issues including diabetes, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. Half of US adults try to lose weight each year. Most often, they attempt to do so by exercising more and eating less, since negative net calorie intake is associated with weight loss. To aid in this process, many individuals use calorie-tracking apps. MyFitnessPal, for example, is an online calorie counter used to track and work toward weight loss goals. Users can track calories through diet and workout logs, and they can provide weight information over time.

To create this, the data is first pre-processed. This data is pre-processed and cleaned from the existing data source (Kaggle). AFter this, statistical analysis is performed using the StatsModel module. This module is used to explore data, estimate statistical models. In addition, the Seaborn module is used to incorporate statistical trends. These create line plots for the user to interpret.

Our goal was to create a Machine Learning model that helps people reach their nutrition goal in mind. For example, consumers know that having a lot of protein in their diet is important to have to retain their muscle mass. So in this instance, the user can type in a food, and the model will recommend a meal that represents the user's wants and needs (in this example, a protein shake, chicken, broccoli, and rice is the dish that will be recommended to them).
