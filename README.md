Nowadays, a healthy lifestyle is becoming a valuable characteristic of modern society. More and more people try to enhance their health by doing regularly different sports and put emphasis on their food habits. In order to satisfy the specific needs of every individual, conclusions gained out of the usersâ€™ data are of high importance. The healthcare industry is booming, especially when it comes to the analysis of health-related data. 39% of adults worldwide and over 65% of US adults are clinically overweight or diagnosed with obesity. Overweight and obesity increase the risk for health issues including diabetes, hypertension, and osteoarthritis. Half of US adults try to lose weight each year. Most often, they attempt to do so by exercising more and eating less, since negative net calorie intake is associated with weight loss. To aid in this process, many individuals use calorie-tracking apps. MyFitnessPal, for example, is an online calorie counter used to track and work toward weight loss goals. Users can track calories through diet and workout logs, and they can provide weight information over time.
